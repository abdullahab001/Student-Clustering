# Enhancing Learner Targeting Strategies: Insights from Scaler's Clustering Analysis

**Project Overview:**

Our project at Scaler involved clustering learners from the Scaler database to identify distinct groups based on job profiles, company affiliations, and other relevant features. By employing K Means clustering, we aimed to enhance our understanding of learner demographics and preferences, enabling targeted strategies for course promotion and engagement.

**Solution Approach:**

We utilized K Means clustering to segment learners into distinct clusters based on their job profiles, company affiliations, and related attributes. This approach allowed us to identify common characteristics among learners and tailor our offerings accordingly.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

Our dataset included information on learners' job profiles, company affiliations, and other relevant features. We preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure optimal performance of the clustering algorithm.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

We trained the K Means clustering algorithm on the preprocessed data to identify clusters with similar characteristics. We evaluated the quality of the clustering solution using metrics such as silhouette score and within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

**Results and Recommendations:**

Upon analysis, we identified Cluster 0 as particularly noteworthy due to its members exhibiting lower-than-average CTC, even among professionals with over 10 years of experience. The average CTC for Cluster 0 falls below 45 Lakhs per Annum, suggesting potential opportunities for targeted intervention.

Additionally, focusing solely on experienced professionals may not yield optimal results, as individuals in this cluster likely skew older, with an average age of 35+. To address this, we recommend incorporating age as a factor in future data collection efforts. By targeting younger audiences who are more likely to be receptive to course offerings, we can optimize resource allocation and improve campaign effectiveness.

**Actionable Insights & Recommendations:**

1. **Focus on Cluster 0:** Prioritize efforts on learners within Cluster 0, where CTC levels are comparatively low despite significant experience. Tailor marketing and outreach efforts to address the specific needs and preferences of this segment.

2. **Incorporate Age Factor:** Introduce age as a factor in data collection processes to better target younger audiences who are more likely to be receptive to course offerings. This refinement will optimize resource allocation and improve campaign effectiveness.

3. **Diversify Targeting Strategies:** While experienced professionals are valuable, broaden targeting strategies to include younger audiences who may be more inclined to pursue further education and skills development.

By implementing these recommendations, Scaler can enhance its marketing effectiveness, improve learner engagement, and ultimately, drive greater success in its mission to empower software professionals through advanced education and training.
